# Building-Microservices-and-a-CI-CD-Pipeline-with-AWS

In this project, you’re challenged to use at least 11 AWS offerings, including some that might be new to you, to build a microservices and continuous integration and continuous development (CI/CD) solution. 

By the end of this project, you should be able to do the following:
1. Recognize how a Node.js web application is coded and deployed to run and connect to a relational database where the application data is stored.
2. Create an AWS Cloud9 integrated development environment (IDE) and a code repository (repo) in which to store the application code.
3. Split the functionality of a monolithic application into separate containerized microservices.
4. Use a container registry to store and version control containerized microservice Docker images.
5. Create code repositories to store microservice source code and CI/CD deployment assets.
6. Create a serverless cluster to fulfill cost optimization and scalability solution requirements.
7. Configure an Application Load Balancer and multiple target groups to route traffic between microservices.
8. Create a code pipeline to deploy microservices containers to a blue/green cluster deployment.
9. Use the code pipeline and code repository for CI/CD by iterating on the application design.

# Scenario

The owners of a café corporation with many franchise locations have noticed how popular their gourmet coffee offerings have become. 

Customers (the café franchise location managers) cannot seem to get enough of the high-quality coffee beans that are needed to create amazing cappuccinos and lattes in their cafés. 

Meanwhile, the employees in the café corporate office have been challenged to consistently source the highest-quality coffee beans. Recently, the leaders at the corporate office learned that one of their favorite coffee suppliers wants to sell her company. The café corporate managers jumped at the opportunity to buy the company. The acquired coffee supplier runs a coffee supplier listings application on an AWS account, as shown in the following image.
